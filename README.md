# NextGen-Project-Global-Logistics-Inc

USER STORY:

At Global Logistics Inc,
We want to develop a machine to help us: 

 > Process Service Catalog Orders For Employees

 > Govern Sensitive Company Data with ACLs

 > Streamline Processes & Operations by monitoring Fraud Alerts


Currently, the Fulfillment Management group has been facing difficulties while ordering a service catalog item, the Supercharger LT Battery. We want to consolidate Supercharger LT Battery orders in the pipeline by creating an automated workflow for battery requests. The Fulfillment Management group plans to create roles, ACLs, and asset taggers to configure forms, records, tables, and the service catalog item for the Supercharger LT Battery.
The Fulfillment Management group has also addressed potential losses pertaining to excessive orders with unauthorized forms of payment. We plan to create a fraud alert monitor table, extended to the Incident table, to track alert levels for potential fraud in financial transactions to quickly address fraudulent activities affecting our operations. The workflow for this monitor will trigger when a record is created or updated!
